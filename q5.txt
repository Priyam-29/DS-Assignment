CREATE TWO STACKS : ASCENDING, DESCENDING
PUSH -INFINITY INTO ASCENDING
PUSH +INFINITY INTO DESCENDNG
IF THE CURRENT ELEMENT IS > THE ASCENDING TOP
CHECK IT WITH THE DESCENDING TOP
OTHERWISE, MOVE ELEMENTS FROM THE ASCENDING TO THE DESCENDING UNTIL THE CURRENT ELEMENT BECOMES > THE ASCENDING TOP
IF THE CURRENT ELEMENT IS < THE DESCENDING TOP 
THEN THIS IS THE INSERTION POINT
OTHERWISE, MOVE ELEMENTS FROM THE DESCENDING TO THE ASCENDING UNTIL THE CURRENT ELEMENT BECOMES < THE DESCENDING TOP
PUSH THE CURRENT ELEMENT INTO THE ASCENDING STACK
PROCESS NEXT ELEMENT TO THE DESCENDING IF ANY
NOW MOVE ALL ELEMENTS OF ASCENDING TO DESCENDING STACK
HENCE WE HAVE ALL ELEMENTS IN ASCENDING ORDER
